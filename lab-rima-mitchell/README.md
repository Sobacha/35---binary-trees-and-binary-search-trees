# Overview
This is an exploration into the `pre/post/in-order` traversal methods of Binary Tree data structures. Also included is an implementation of Binary Search Tree data structures: inserting, finding, removing nodes as well as determining if the tree is balanced (i.e. one or less difference in depth between the two branches).

**Example of _imbalanced_ Binary Search Tree:**
```
          10
         /  \
        7    13
       /     
      5
     / \
    4   6
```
**Example of _balanced_ Binary Search Tree:**
```
          10        ||        10
         /  \       ||       /  \
        7    13     ||      7    13
       / \          ||     / \     \
      5   8         ||    5   8     15
```

# Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. If wanting to view tests, enter `npm install -D` into the command line. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
